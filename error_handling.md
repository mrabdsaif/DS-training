### Errors handling

# EH is when I have a problem with my codes that is running and that is someting not predictable
# common examples for that a permissions issues, database changing, server being down, these errors I donnt have control over them.

### Debugging:
# Debugging is when I know that there is a problem with my code 
# that is potentially giving me a wrong answer, potentially crashing
# and the reson of these things refer to something I have done incorrectly

### Types of errors :

## Syntax Error :
# This type of error indicate that your code will not run at all 
# The error msg that you are going to get will typically point you to right to where the error exactly is

## Runtime Errors: 
# This type of errors blow up when our code is running, and the error msg gives information where you can start your debugging process.

## logic Errors :
# when there is no syntax error, there is no error msg so there is no runtime errors, but it does not give us the response that we need.
# but the reson behind this kind of error is an inncorrect error.
